## What is SIG Community anyway ?

SIG is a Special Interest Group created to make KUIS students (especially FSTM) to be:
  * More productive in this digital world.
  * Well exposes in IT.
  * Communicate with other coder.
  * learn new things faster with the community.
  * Have a good discussion about techie stuff among communities.

The goal is to
  * Teach KUIS student "How to CREATE".
  * Increase awareness about IT world.
  * Love to code and make awesome project.

SIG divided into three main interest categories:
  * Open Source
  * Web and Mobile app Development
  * Information Security

Feel free to choose any three above you are love to learn (kuasai). We are also provide module structure each of three 
categories inside the folder.

## ... So what is Open Source ?

The term "Open Source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is to publicly accessible.

[Here](https://youtu.be/a8fHgx9mE5U) some good animated explaination about Open Source.

## ... What about Developer?

This time we mean programmer (developer), the person who developing a computer program, there will be two type of project 
which is we are developing on mobile apps (Android) and web. Anyone who interested to make mobile app development using 
[android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) required to know at 
least the basics of JAVA programming. Of course there is always various methods to create an android app. 

Both mobile apps and web development required two main principles which is frontend and backend. To make it's simple, 
[here](https://youtu.be/Q5763pPchvw) example of what frontend does. 
 
So what makes the front end of a website possible? Where is all that data stored? This is where the back end comes in. 
The back end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains 
the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in 
the first place.

## Information Security... ?

Information security is an interest module that focusing on security issues and learn about how it works and how to prevent 
it. In this module, we exposing students about the basics of security guidelines. As the time goes by, we'll be get 
further into it. In this module also shows the demonstration how an attack or a hacking process works in different 
kinds of situation and we'll learn how to prevent these issues.

## okay .. then, how SIG work?

First we have to sleep all day, and stay up all night with help of a few cups of coffees. and loop through all these process 
until all your project done.
