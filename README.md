## What is SIG Community anyway ?

SIG is a Special Interest Group created to make KUIS students (especially FSTM) to be:
  * More productive in this digital world.
  * Well exposes in IT.
  * Communicate with other coder.
  * learn new things faster with the community.
  * Have a good discussion about techie stuff among communities.

The goal is to
  * Increase awareness about IT world.
  * Love to code and make awesome project.

SIG divided into three main interest categories:
  * Open Source
  * Web and Mobile app Development
  * Information Security

Feel free to choose any three above you are love to learn (kuasai). We are also provide module structure each of three categories inside the folder.

## ... So what is Open Source ?

The term "Open Source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is to publicly accessible.

[Here](https://youtu.be/a8fHgx9mE5U) some good animated explaination about Open Source.

## ... What about Developer?

In the second field of interest, there will be two type of project which is we are developing on mobile apps or web. In mobile app development, we coded using JAVA programming language. Anyone who interested to join in mobile app development required to know at least the basics of JAVA programming. The mobile platform that we talking about is Android OS.
<br><br>
On web development, first we'll learn on the front-end side. Which is we learn how to write an interface and behavior of a website using various kinds of frameworks available. After finish designing the interface, then we'll learn the back-end - How to manipulate the data with the database, CRUD, and so on.

This time we mean programmer ( developer ), the person who developing a computer system. There are two type we need to consider. Frontend and Backend,
which is we will not explain here. But check [this](https://youtu.be/Q5763pPchvw) out, this is developer job. And [here]() also developer jobs.

## Information Security... ?

Information security is an interest module that focusing on security issues and learn about how it works and how to prevent it. In this module, we exposing students about the basics of security guidelines. As the time goes by, we'll be get further into it. In this module also shows the demonstration how an attack or a hacking process works in different kinds of situation and we'll learn how to prevent these issues.

## okay .. then, how SIG work?

First we have to sleep all day, and stay up all night with help of a few cups of coffees. and loop through all these process until all your project done.

on my way..
