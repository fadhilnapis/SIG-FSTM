## What is SIG Community anyway ?

**SIG is a Special Interest Group created to make KUIS students ..**
  * More productive in this digital world.
  * Well exposes in IT.
  * Communicate with other coder.
  * Learn new things faster with the community.
  * Have a good discussion about techie stuff among communities.

**The goal is to ..**
  * Teach KUIS student "Learn how to CREATE".
  * Increase awareness about today's digital world.
  * Becoming a self-taught programmer.
  * Love to code and make awesome project.
  * Student can compete with outside world.

**SIG divided into three main interest categories ..**
  * Open Source
  * Web and Mobile app Development
  * Information Security

Feel free to choose any three above you are love to learn and master. We are also provide module structure each of three 
categories inside the folder.

## ... So what is Open Source ?

The term "Open Source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is to publicly accessible.

[Here](https://youtu.be/a8fHgx9mE5U) some good animated explaination about Open Source.

## ... What about Developer?

There will be two types of projects we are working on soon, web and mobile app. 
Anyone who interested to make mobile app development using 
[android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) required to know at 
least the basics of JAVA programming. Of course there is always various methods to create an android app. 

Both mobile apps and web development required two main principles which is frontend and backend. To make it's simple, 
[here](https://youtu.be/Q5763pPchvw) example of what frontend does. 
 
So what makes the front end of a website possible? Where is all that data stored? This is where the back end comes in. 
The back end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains 
the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in 
the first place.

## Information Security... ?

Information security is an interest module that focusing on security issues and learn about how it works and how to prevent 
it. In this module, we exposing students about the basics of security guidelines. As the time goes by, we'll be get 
further into it. In this module also shows the demonstration how an attack or a hacking process works in different 
kinds of situation and we'll learn how to prevent these issues.

## okay .. then, how SIG work?

We will make a class once a week every tuesday night, discussing a topic we specify. 
To keep what we learned longger, we use 
github which will save our code into the cloud and recode it perfectly.

To keep track our SIG activity in github, we use gitter as a chat platform which we already setup to integerate with SIG github repo.
We will also make a training in a certains topic that need to focus more. 

Also we will joining outside events that relate to our scope of learning for example JOMLAUNCH, 
raspberry pi JAM, Startup and Developer Meetup and more.

You can also participate with outside competition offers by university or company or FSTM itself 
which will test your skill and knowledge.
